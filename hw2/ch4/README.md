# Homework 2: Chapter 4: Manual Pages

**manual pages** explain every command available on your system, what they do, how to run them and what arguments they accept

`man` is the manual pages command

    man <command to look up>

exit man pages using `q`


## Searching

- can do a keyword search on the manual pages

    `man -k <search term>`

- search within a manual page using `/` followed by the term to search for
- select the next found item with either `ENTER` or `n`


## Running Commands

commands have short and long hand versions

- long hand is more human readable
- short hand is useful for chaining multiple commands together

- short hand options begin with a single dash `-`
- long hand optios begin with two dashes `--`
